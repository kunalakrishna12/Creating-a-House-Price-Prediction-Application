## House Price Prediction Project

### Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on features such as the number of rooms and square footage using machine learning techniques. It provides a practical demonstration of building a predictive model for real estate applications.

### Features
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Generated synthetic data to simulate real-world scenarios.
- **Linear Regression Model**: Implemented a linear regression model using scikit-learn to predict house prices.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the model's performance using mean squared error as the evaluation metric.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualized the predictions against actual prices using matplotlib.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

### Future Improvements
- Explore more advanced regression techniques like polynomial regression or regularization.
- Incorporate additional features such as location, age of the house, and amenities to improve prediction accuracy.
- Perform feature scaling or normalization for better model convergence.
- Evaluate the model's performance using additional metrics like R-squared.
